# Kuzdra

Гло́кая ку́здра ште́ко будлану́ла бо́кра и курдя́чит бокрёнка

Glokaya kuzdra shteko budlanula bokra i kurdyachit bokryonka

A nonce sentence translated into ~80 languages. The phrase that has been proposed by a Russian linguist Lev Scherba consists of nonce stems (wugs) put in a grammatically valid way (i.e. syntax and morphology follow the Russian grammar, all affixes are real). This example demostrates that the information is sufficient to reconstruct and visualize the dramatic action described. 

The phrase was popularized by Lev Uspensky in his popular science book `A Word about Words'

More: 
 - Lewis Carroll's ``Jabberwocky'' is another example from English literature 
 - Henry Allan Gleason's ``The iggle squiggs trazed wombly in the harlish hoop``
