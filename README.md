A nonce sentence translated into 100 languages. The phrase that has been proposed by a Russian linguist Lev Scherba consists of nonce stems (wugs) put in a grammatical valid way (i.e. syntax and morphology follow the Russian grammar, all affixes are real). This example demostrates that the information is sufficient to reconstruct and visualize the dramatic action described. 

The phrase was popularized by Lev Uspensky in his popular science book `A Word about Words'
